# template-aastex

This provides a streamlined template for writing a manuscript using [AASTeX](https://github.com/AASJournals/AASTeX60). Much more detail can be found in the full template with the AASTeX Github project, but this provides a quick document to hit the ground running.

I aim to update this alongside changes to AASTeX itself.
